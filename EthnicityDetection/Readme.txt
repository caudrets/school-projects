In this folder are, as specified, my report, presentation, and source code.

Any of the four source code files can be used. 
There is one python program for each architecture (Generic_Architecture has more explanatory comments).
Each program is saved as either a .py python file or as a .ipynb notebook file.

As this project was done in Google Collab notebooks, there are specific code dependencies relevant to Google Collab.
It probably will not be possible for you to simply open these python files and run them. 
The video submitted online should give a good overview of my programming.
